# Python Weather Forecasting Tool üåßÔ∏è

This project is a command-line tool and GUI application that accepts a city's name as input and returns the current weather forecast. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parses it using Python. The project also showcases how GitHub Copilot can assist with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

## Features 

- Accepts a city's name as input and retrieves the current weather forecast.
- Provides a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) for convenience.
- Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
- Parses the fetched data using Python.
- Demonstrates GitHub Copilot's capabilities in assisting with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

## Requirements 

To run this project, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- An API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can obtain a free API key by signing up on their website.
- Github Copilot

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/punam01/Microsoft-Github-Copilot-Hackathon.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory(say weather-forecast-tool):

```bash
cd weather-forecast-tool
```
3. Create a file named .env in the project directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key to it:
```
API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
```

## Useage üñ±Ô∏è

### Command-line Interface (CLI) üìã
To use the command-line interface, run the following command:
```
python tool.py
```

### Graphical-user Interface (GUI) üíª
To use the Graphical-user interface, run the following command:
```
python gui.py
```
A window will open where you can enter the city's name and click a button to retrieve the current weather forecast.

## Troubleshooting ü©π

1. If you encounter any issues with the tool, ensure that you have entered a valid API key in the .env file.
2. Check your internet connection to ensure that you can access the OpenWeatherMap API.
